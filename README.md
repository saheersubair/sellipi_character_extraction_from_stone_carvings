# Sellipi Character Extraction From Old Stone Carvings


The goal of this project is to develop and image processing program for the extraction characters from the Sellipi stone inscriptions found in various parts of Sri Lanka which was written long time back. Investigating and identifying characters could help us to understand more about our ancient culture and also may lead us to find solutions to future problems by learning how they solved those problems in ancient times which are written in Sellipi inscriptions.
The image extraction process involves image acquisition, pre-processing of the image, text segmentation, automatic character extraction, manual character extraction, character enhancement and report writing.

Materials Used
1.	Computer with Anaconda Environment & Jupiter Notebook installed.
2.	OpenCV, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries.
3.	High quality images of the Sellipi inscriptions.
